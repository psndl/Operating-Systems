## Introduction to Semaphores

### What are Semaphores?

- **Powerful synchronization tools** used to solve various synchronization problems
- Can solve **mutual exclusion problems** (critical section problems)
- Can enforce **process waiting** until specific events occur
- Used extensively in **Project 2** for synchronization

### Kernel Implementation

- Semaphores are implemented in the kernel
- The pseudocode shown is a typical implementation (not the only way)
- Implementation details may vary across different systems

## Problems with Semaphores

### 1. Deadlocks

**Definition**: Two or more processes waiting indefinitely for an event that can only be caused by one of the waiting processes.

#### Deadlock Example

Consider two semaphores `S` and `Q`, both initialized to 1:

**Process P0:**

```
wait(S);     // Acquire S
wait(Q);     // Acquire Q
/* Critical Section */
signal(S);   // Release S
signal(Q);   // Release Q
```

**Process P1:**

```
wait(Q);     // Acquire Q
wait(S);     // Acquire S  
/* Critical Section */
signal(Q);   // Release Q
signal(S);   // Release S
```

#### How Deadlock Occurs:

1. P0 executes `wait(S)` → S becomes 0, P0 continues
2. Context switch occurs
3. P1 executes `wait(Q)` → Q becomes 0, P1 continues
4. P1 executes `wait(S)` → S is 0, P1 blocks
5. P0 resumes and executes `wait(Q)` → Q is 0, P0 blocks
6. **Both processes are now blocked waiting for each other**

#### Solution:

- **Consistent ordering** of resource requests
- If both processes request S first, then Q, deadlock is avoided

### 2. Starvation

**Definition**: A process may never be removed from the semaphore queue if the kernel uses LIFO (Last In, First Out) ordering.

- Process remains indefinitely in the waiting queue
- Never gets service despite resources becoming available
- Can occur due to poor scheduling policies

### 3. Priority Inversion

**Scenario**: Lower priority process holds a lock needed by higher priority process.

#### Example:

- **High priority process**: Waiting for semaphore held by low priority process
- **Medium priority process**: Running and preventing low priority process from executing
- **Low priority process**: Cannot run to release the lock

#### Result:

Medium priority process effectively blocks high priority process.

#### Solutions:

- **Priority inheritance**: Low priority process temporarily inherits high priority
- Prevents medium priority process from preempting

## Classic Synchronization Problems

### 1. Bounded Buffer Problem (Producer-Consumer)

#### Problem Description:

- **Producer**: Generates items and puts them in buffer
- **Consumer**: Removes items from buffer and consumes them
- **Buffer**: Shared, bounded capacity (max N items)
- **Requirements**:
    - Mutual exclusion for buffer access
    - Producer sleeps when buffer is full
    - Consumer sleeps when buffer is empty

#### Solution Using Semaphores:

**Semaphore Definitions:**

```c
semaphore mutex = 1;    // Protects buffer access
semaphore full = 0;     // Counts full slots
semaphore empty = N;    // Counts empty slots (N = buffer size)
```

**Producer Code:**

```c
while (true) {
    // Produce item
    produce_item(&item);
    
    // Wait for empty slot
    wait(empty);
    
    // Acquire buffer lock
    wait(mutex);
    
    // Add item to buffer
    add_to_buffer(item);
    
    // Release buffer lock
    signal(mutex);
    
    // Signal that buffer has one more full slot
    signal(full);
}
```

**Consumer Code:**

```c
while (true) {
    // Wait for full slot
    wait(full);
    
    // Acquire buffer lock
    wait(mutex);
    
    // Remove item from buffer
    item = remove_from_buffer();
    
    // Release buffer lock
    signal(mutex);
    
    // Signal that buffer has one more empty slot
    signal(empty);
    
    // Consume item
    consume_item(item);
}
```

#### Key Points:

- `mutex` ensures only one process accesses buffer at a time
- `empty` tracks available space (producer waits if 0)
- `full` tracks available items (consumer waits if 0)
- **Order matters**: Always acquire counting semaphore first, then mutex

### 2. Readers-Writers Problem

#### Problem Description:

- **Readers**: Only read shared data (multiple readers allowed simultaneously)
- **Writers**: Read and modify shared data (exclusive access required)
- **Rules**:
    - Multiple readers can access data simultaneously
    - Only one writer can access data at a time
    - No readers when writer is active
    - No writers when readers are active

#### Solution Using Semaphores:

**Shared Variables:**

```c
int read_count = 0;     // Number of active readers
semaphore mutex = 1;    // Protects read_count
semaphore wrt = 1;      // Controls access to shared data
```

**Writer Process:**

```c
while (true) {
    wait(wrt);          // Acquire exclusive access
    
    /* Writing operation */
    write_data();
    
    signal(wrt);        // Release exclusive access
}
```

**Reader Process:**

```c
while (true) {
    // Update reader count
    wait(mutex);
    read_count++;
    if (read_count == 1) {
        wait(wrt);      // First reader acquires lock
    }
    signal(mutex);
    
    /* Reading operation */
    read_data();
    
    // Update reader count
    wait(mutex);
    read_count--;
    if (read_count == 0) {
        signal(wrt);    // Last reader releases lock
    }
    signal(mutex);
}
```

#### Key Points:

- First reader acquires the write lock
- Subsequent readers just increment counter
- Last reader releases the write lock
- Writers wait until all readers finish

### 3. Dining Philosophers Problem

#### Problem Description:

- **5 philosophers** sitting around a circular table
- **5 forks** (one between each pair of philosophers)
- Each philosopher needs **2 forks** (left and right) to eat
- **States**: Thinking (no forks needed) or Eating (2 forks needed)
- **Goal**: Allow maximum concurrency while avoiding deadlock and starvation

#### Simple Solution (Has Deadlock Risk):

**Semaphore Definitions:**

```c
semaphore chopstick[5] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}; // One per fork
```

**Philosopher i Code:**

```c
while (true) {
    think();
    
    wait(chopstick[i]);           // Pick up left fork
    wait(chopstick[(i+1) % 5]);   // Pick up right fork
    
    eat();
    
    signal(chopstick[i]);         // Put down left fork
    signal(chopstick[(i+1) % 5]); // Put down right fork
}
```

#### Problems with Simple Solution:

- **Deadlock possible**: All philosophers pick up left fork simultaneously
- **Circular wait**: Each waits for neighbor's right fork
- Occurs infrequently but is a serious problem

#### Solution Properties Desired:

1. **Concurrency**: Multiple philosophers should eat simultaneously when possible
2. **No Deadlock**: System should never reach deadlock state
3. **No Starvation**: Every philosopher should eventually get to eat

## Common Programming Mistakes

### 1. Wrong Order of Operations

```c
// WRONG - Signal before Wait
signal(mutex);
/* Critical Section */
wait(mutex);
```

**Problem**: Critical section is not protected

### 2. Double Wait on Same Semaphore

```c
// WRONG - Two waits, no signal
wait(mutex);
/* Critical Section */
wait(mutex);  // Should be signal(mutex)
```

**Problem**: Causes deadlock, no process can acquire mutex

### 3. Missing Operations

```c
// WRONG - Missing signal
wait(mutex);
/* Critical Section */
// Forgot signal(mutex)
```

**Problem**: Mutex never released, other processes blocked forever

### 4. Mismatched Wait/Signal

```c
// WRONG - Wait on different semaphore than signal
wait(semA);
/* Critical Section */
signal(semB);  // Should be signal(semA)
```

**Problem**: semA never released, semB incorrectly incremented

## Summary

### Semaphore Strengths:

- **Powerful**: Can solve complex synchronization problems
- **Flexible**: Support both binary and counting semantics
- **Efficient**: Processes sleep instead of busy waiting

### Semaphore Weaknesses:

- **Error-prone**: Easy to make mistakes that cause deadlock or incorrect behavior
- **No built-in deadlock prevention**: Programmer must ensure correct ordering
- **Debugging difficulty**: Race conditions and deadlocks can be intermittent

### Best Practices:

1. **Consistent resource ordering** to prevent deadlock
2. **Always pair wait() and signal()** operations
3. **Acquire counting semaphores before binary semaphores**
4. **Use timeouts** when possible to detect deadlocks
5. **Test thoroughly** under high concurrency

### Looking Forward:

- Need for **higher-level synchronization primitives**
- **Monitors** and other alternatives to semaphores
- **Automatic deadlock detection and prevention** mechanisms
