## 1. **Overview & Objectives ðŸŽ¯**

- **Purpose**: Explore how operating systems manage files and directories, mapping them efficiently to storage media.
    
- **Core tasks**:
    
    - File and directory creation/deletion
        
    - File operations: open, read, write, close, seek
        
    - Metadata handling: permissions, ownership, file size, timestamps ([youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYRiU-aXuqI&utm_source=chatgpt.com "CS-342 Operating Systems Lecture 39 - YouTube"), [m.youtube.com](https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=88s&v=_h30HBYxtws&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Explaining File Systems: NTFS, exFAT, FAT32, ext4 & More - YouTube"))

## 2. **File System Abstraction**

- **Definition**: Logical structures that allow users and apps to access persistent data without dealing directly with disk hardware .
    
- **Persistent storage**: Survives reboots, unlike volatile memory.
    
- **File operations**: Standard system calls â€“ `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`, `lseek()`, `fsync()`, `rename()`, `stat()` .

## 3. **Storage Structures**

- **Data blocks**: Fixed-unit storage; typical sizes 512â€¯Bâ€“2â€¯KB.
    
- **Inodes**:
    
    - Metadata container: size, timestamps, permissions, block pointers ([youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?pp=ygUOI2ZsaWVzdHJ1Y3R1cmU%3D&v=atYQBTHnjyY&utm_source=chatgpt.com "39 - Windows File System Structures - YouTube")).
        
    - Identified by a unique inode number.
        
- **Directories**: Essentially files that map names â†’ inode numbers.
    
- **Free-space management**:
    
    - Bitmap or free-list tracking unused blocks .
        

---

## 4. **File Allocation Techniques**

- **Contiguous allocation**: Simple and fast, but suffers fragmentation.
    
- **Linked allocation**: Blocks linked via pointers; no fragmentation, but poor random access.
    
- **Indexed (inode-based)**:
    
    - Direct pointers in inode.
        
    - Indirect, double, triple indirection for large files.
        
- **Extents**: Store ranges of contiguous blocks (start, length), reducing metadata overhead .

## 5. **Performance Optimization**

- **Locality**: Group related data blocks to reduce disk seeks ([youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?pp=ygUOI2ZsaWVzdHJ1Y3R1cmU%3D&v=atYQBTHnjyY&utm_source=chatgpt.com "39 - Windows File System Structures - YouTube")).
    
- **Multi-level indexing**: Efficient access even for large files by layering indexes .
    
- **Caching (buffer cache)**: Keeps frequently accessed blocks in memory for speed .
    

---

## 6. **Consistency & Reliability**

- **File metadata must be accurate**, especially after crashes.
    
- **Journaling file systems**: Log metadata (or both data+metadata) before committing to disk to ensure atomicity and reduce corruption risk .
    
- **Soft-updates and fsck tools**:
    
    - Soft-updates avoid inconsistent layouts without full journaling.
        
    - `fsck` verifies free lists, inodes, link counts, and block allocation .
        

---

## 7. **Mass-Storage Management**

- OS also handles disk scheduling, device control, bad-block tracking, and backups .
    
- **Backups**:
    
    - Full vs. incremental strategies.
        
    - Best practice: Rotate multiple full backups (e.g., keep last three) to hedge against data loss ([m.youtube.com](https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=88s&v=_h30HBYxtws&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Explaining File Systems: NTFS, exFAT, FAT32, ext4 & More - YouTube")).

## 8. **Common File Systems & Features**

- **Unix-style inodes**: Fundamental abstraction; supports hard links and file consistency .
    
- **Journaling systems**:
    
    - ext3, ext4, NTFS, JFS (IBM), XFS.
        
    - Typically journal metadata; JFS uses a sizable journal (~128â€¯MB) ([m.youtube.com](https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=88s&v=_h30HBYxtws&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Explaining File Systems: NTFS, exFAT, FAT32, ext4 & More - YouTube")).
        
- **Log-structured FS**: Treats disk as a log; uses checkpoints for fast recovery and employs garbage collection .

## 9. **Design Trade-offs**

|Design|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|---|
|Contiguous|Fast access|Prone to fragmentation|
|Extents|Efficient metadata|Complex management|
|Journaling|Quick recovery|Overhead in writes|
|LFS|Fast writes|Garbage collection required|

## 10. **Putting It All Together**

- The file system is the **OS component enabling persistent, structured data storage**.
    
- It includes:
    
    - **Interface API**: System calls for interaction.
        
    - **On-disk data structures**: Inodes, blocks, directories.
        
    - **Allocation & mapping logic**: Contiguous/extent/indexed.
        
    - **Reliability layer**: Journaling, fsck, backups.
        
- File system design is a complex balance of performance, reliability, and ease of use.
