## üìò 1. Overview of Scheduling Concepts

- The CPU scheduler (short-term) selects which process in the ready queue runs next ([cs.csustan.edu](https://www.cs.csustan.edu/~john/Classes/Previous_Semesters/CS3750_OperatingSys_I/2022_02_Spr/Notes/Chap05/05_CPU_Scheduling.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Chapter Five -- CPU Scheduling -- Lecture Notes")).
    
- Key goals: maximize CPU utilization & throughput; minimize wait time, turnaround time, response time; ensure fairness and avoid starvation ([tiu.edu.iq](https://tiu.edu.iq/it/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/OS-Lect-4_CPU-Scheduling.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Lecture 4 CPU Scheduling")).
    
- Two modes:
    
    - **Non‚Äëpreemptive**: process runs until completion or blocks (‚Äúcooperative‚Äù).
        
    - **Preemptive**: can be interrupted (e.g., timer expires or higher‚Äëpriority arrives) .

## 2. Scheduling Algorithms

### A. First‚ÄëCome First‚ÄëServe (FCFS)

- Non‚Äëpreemptive, simple FIFO queue.
    
- Easy to implement but can cause _convoy effect_ and long average wait times ([tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling_algorithms.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Process Scheduling Algorithms in Operating Systems - Tutorialspoint"), [tiu.edu.iq](https://tiu.edu.iq/it/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/OS-Lect-4_CPU-Scheduling.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Lecture 4 CPU Scheduling")).
    

### B. Shortest Job First (SJF / SJN)

- Can be preemptive or non-preemptive.
    
- Chooses job with shortest predicted CPU burst next.
    
- Minimizes average waiting time but requires burst prediction (hard for interactive systems) ([people.csail.mit.edu](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rinard/teaching/osnotes/h6.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Operating Systems Lecture Notes Lecture 6 CPU Scheduling"), [tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling_algorithms.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Process Scheduling Algorithms in Operating Systems - Tutorialspoint")).
    
- **SRJF or SRTF**: preemptive version. If a new job arrives with a shorter remaining burst, CPU is preempted ([cs.uic.edu](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/5_CPU_Scheduling.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Operating Systems: CPU Scheduling")).
    
- Example average wait times: preemptive ~6.5‚ÄØms vs non‚Äëpreemptive ~7.75‚ÄØms for sample dataset ([cs.uic.edu](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/5_CPU_Scheduling.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Operating Systems: CPU Scheduling")).
    

### C. Priority Scheduling

- Assigns priority to each job; CPU runs highest‚Äëpriority next.
    
- Preemptive or non‚Äëpreemptive.
    
- SJF = priority scheduling where priority = inverse of CPU burst ([cs.uic.edu](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/5_CPU_Scheduling.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Operating Systems: CPU Scheduling")).
    
- Problems:
    
    - **Starvation**: low‚Äëpriority jobs may never run.
        
    - **Solution**: _aging_ ‚Äì gradually elevate priority of waiting jobs ([tiu.edu.iq](https://tiu.edu.iq/it/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/OS-Lect-4_CPU-Scheduling.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Lecture 4 CPU Scheduling"), [cs.uic.edu](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/5_CPU_Scheduling.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Operating Systems: CPU Scheduling")).
        

### D. Round Robin (RR)

- Preemptive, time‚Äësliced (quantum q).
    
- Timer interrupts after q; process re-enters end of queue if not complete.
    
- Good response time, fair, starvation‚Äëfree ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_scheduling?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Round-robin scheduling"), [cs.uic.edu](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/5_CPU_Scheduling.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Operating Systems: CPU Scheduling"), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_%28computing%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Scheduling (computing)")).
    
- Performance depends on quantum choice:
    
    - Large q ‚Üí behaves like FCFS.
        
    - Small q ‚Üí excessive context switches ‚Üí overhead ([uomustansiriyah.edu.iq](https://uomustansiriyah.edu.iq/media/lectures/6/6_2022_01_10%2108_08_03_AM.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Lecture Six CPU Scheduling")).
        
- Rule of thumb: quantum should exceed context-switch overhead, covering ~80% of bursts ([home.adelphi.edu](https://home.adelphi.edu/~siegfried/cs453/453l5.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] CSC 453 Operating Systems - Lecture 5 : Process Scheduling")).

## 3. Advanced Variants

### Multilevel Queue

- Multiple queues based on process type (e.g. interactive, batch), each with its own scheduling ([tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling_algorithms.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Process Scheduling Algorithms in Operating Systems - Tutorialspoint")).
    
- Fixed assignment; high-priority queues may starve lower ones .
    

### Multilevel **Feedback** Queue

- Like multilevel queue, but processes can move between queues (e.g. demoted for CPU-heavy usage or promoted by aging) ([people.csail.mit.edu](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rinard/teaching/osnotes/h6.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Operating Systems Lecture Notes Lecture 6 CPU Scheduling")).
    
- More flexible and fair; common in Unix/Linux schedulers .

## 4. Comparison Summary

|Algorithm|Preemptive?|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|---|---|
|FCFS|No|Simple|High average wait time|
|SJF|Optional|Optimal avg waiting time|Requires burst knowledge|

## 5. Context Switching & Dispatcher

- **Dispatcher**: component that performs context switches, loads process state, transfers control ([tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling_algorithms.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Process Scheduling Algorithms in Operating Systems - Tutorialspoint"), [cs.uic.edu](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/5_CPU_Scheduling.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Operating Systems: CPU Scheduling"), [tiu.edu.iq](https://tiu.edu.iq/it/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/OS-Lect-4_CPU-Scheduling.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Lecture 4 CPU Scheduling"), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_%28computing%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Scheduling (computing)")).
    
- **Dispatch latency** should be minimized to reduce idle CPU time between processes .
    
- Context-switch time critical; overhead must be balanced against quantum size ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.5348?utm_source=chatgpt.com "A New Round Robin Based Scheduling Algorithm for Operating Systems: Dynamic Quantum Using the Mean Average")).
    

---

## 6. Practical Considerations & Real Systems

- Modern OS use **multilevel feedback queues** (e.g., Unix, Linux CFS, FreeBSD, Solaris) .
    
    - They adapt priorities based on CPU usage history and interactivity.
        
- **Multiprocessor scheduling** adds challenges like load balancing, cache affinity, and gang scheduling ([web.stanford.edu](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/cs140-winter16/lecture.php?topic=scheduling&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Scheduling - Stanford University")).

## ‚úÖ Tips

- Always track metrics: CPU utilization, throughput, response time, waiting/turnaround time, fairness.
    
- Choose algorithm based on system type:
    
    - **Batch/throughput**: SJF/SRTF or priority.
        
    - **Interactive/time-sharing**: Round Robin or feedback queues.
        
- Prevent starvation with aging.

# Note by Gemini
Here is a more detailed note covering all important aspects of the lecture on Process Scheduling:

### Process Scheduling: Detailed Notes

This lecture delves into various process scheduling algorithms, essential for managing how a CPU handles multiple tasks efficiently.

#### 1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Algorithm

- **Concept:** The simplest scheduling algorithm. Processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue. Think of it like a single-lane queue at a shop ‚Äì the first person in line is the first to be served.
    
- **Implementation:** Relatively easy to implement due to its straightforward nature.
    
- **Impact on Waiting Time:** The order of process arrival significantly affects the average waiting time.
    
    - **Convoy Effect:** A major drawback where a long process arriving before several shorter ones can drastically increase the average waiting time for all subsequent processes. For example, if a 10-minute job arrives, followed by three 1-minute jobs, the three 1-minute jobs will have to wait for the entire 10 minutes.
        
    - Conversely, if shorter jobs arrive first, the average waiting time can be much lower.
        
- **Preemption:** FCFS is a **non-preemptive** algorithm. Once a process starts executing, it continues until it completes its CPU burst, or voluntarily yields the CPU.
    

#### 2. Shortest-Job-First (SJF) Scheduling

- **Concept:** This algorithm associates each process with the length of its next CPU burst and then schedules the process with the shortest burst.
    
- **Optimality:** SJF is proven to be optimal in terms of minimizing the average waiting time for a given set of processes. This is because by always running the shortest job next, it gets processes out of the system quickly, reducing the cumulative wait time.
    
- **The Challenge of Prediction:** The main difficulty with SJF is knowing the exact length of the next CPU request in advance. In reality, this is impossible.
    
- **Priority based on Burst Length:** Effectively, the shorter the CPU burst, the higher the priority of the process under SJF.
    
- **Estimating Future Burst Lengths (Exponential Averaging):** To overcome the prediction problem, SJF often relies on estimating the length of the next CPU burst based on the history of previous bursts. Exponential averaging is a common technique used for this:
    
    - **Formula:** œÑn+1‚Äã=Œ±tn‚Äã+(1‚àíŒ±)œÑn‚Äã
        
        - œÑn+1‚Äã: The predicted length of the next (n+1)th CPU burst.
            
        - tn‚Äã: The actual length of the nth CPU burst (the most recently completed burst).
            
        - œÑn‚Äã: The predicted value for the nth CPU burst (the prediction made before the nth burst actually ran).
            
        - Œ±: A weighting factor (alpha) between 0 and 1 (0 ‚â§Œ±‚â§ 1). This factor determines the weight given to recent history.
            
    - A higher Œ± value gives more weight to recent actual burst lengths, making the prediction more responsive to changes. A lower Œ± makes the prediction smoother, less affected by sudden changes.
        
    - This formula ensures that more recent history has a higher influence on the prediction than older history.
        

#### 3. Shortest Remaining Job First (SRJF)

- **Concept:** SRJF is the **preemptive** version of SJF.
    
- **Mechanism:** If a new job arrives in the ready queue whose CPU burst length is shorter than the _remaining_ time of the currently executing job, the operating system preempts the running job. The newly arrived (shorter) job then begins execution immediately.
    
- **Benefit:** This preemption allows for even further reduction in average waiting time compared to non-preemptive SJF, as it prioritizes jobs that are closer to completion as soon as they become the shortest remaining.
    

#### 4. Priority Scheduling

- **Concept:** Each process is assigned a priority number. The CPU is then allocated to the process with the highest priority. Conventionally, a smaller integer value often represents a higher priority (e.g., priority 0 might be higher than priority 5).
    
- **Preemptive vs. Non-preemptive:**
    
    - **Preemptive Priority:** If a new process arrives with a priority higher than the currently running process, the running process is preempted.
        
    - **Non-preemptive Priority:** The currently running process completes its CPU burst even if a higher-priority process arrives.
        
- **The Starvation Problem:** A significant issue with priority scheduling is "starvation" (or indefinite blocking). Low-priority processes might never get to execute if there's a continuous stream of higher-priority processes arriving.
    
- **Aging as a Solution:** To combat starvation, the technique of "aging" is used. This involves gradually increasing the priority of a process as it waits in the ready queue. Over time, even a low-priority process will eventually gain enough priority to be executed.
    

#### 5. Round Robin (RR) Scheduling

- **Concept:** Designed specifically for time-sharing systems, Round Robin provides each process with a small, fixed unit of CPU time called a "time quantum" (or time slice), typically between 10 to 100 milliseconds.
    
- **Mechanism:**
    
    1. Processes are held in a circular ready queue.
        
    2. The scheduler picks the first process from the queue.
        
    3. It allocates the CPU to this process for one time quantum.
        
    4. If the process completes its CPU burst within the quantum, it releases the CPU.
        
    5. If the process does not complete within the quantum, it is preempted and moved to the end of the ready queue.
        
- **Fairness:** It ensures that each process gets a fair share of the CPU over time. If there are 'n' processes in the ready queue and the time quantum is 'q', then each process waits at most (n-1)q time units before its next turn.
    
- **Performance and Time Quantum Size (q):** The size of the time quantum is crucial for RR's performance:
    
    - **Large `q`:** If the time quantum is very large (e.g., infinity), RR essentially behaves like FCFS.
        
    - **Small `q`:** If the time quantum is very small, it can lead to excessive context switching overhead.
        
- **Context Switch Overhead:**
    
    - A context switch is the process of saving the state of one process and loading the state of another. It's pure overhead, as no useful work is done during this time.
        
    - A smaller time quantum means more frequent context switches, increasing overhead.
        
    - The time quantum must be significantly larger than the context switch time to be efficient (e.g., if context switch is 1 microsecond, a 10ms quantum means 0.01% overhead).
        
- **Response Time vs. Turnaround Time:**
    
    - **Response Time:** RR generally provides better _response time_ (the time it takes for a process to receive its first CPU service) compared to SJF, as all processes get a chance to run quickly.
        
    - **Turnaround Time:** However, the average _turnaround time_ (total time from arrival to completion) for RR can often be higher than SJF, especially for jobs with varying burst times.
        

#### 6. Turnaround Time Variation with Time Quantum

- The relationship between the time quantum and average turnaround time is complex.
    
- While a very small quantum can lead to high overhead and thus higher turnaround time due to frequent context switches, a very large quantum can make RR degenerate to FCFS, which might also lead to high turnaround times if long jobs are at the front.
    
- There's often an **optimal range** for the time quantum that balances the benefits of responsiveness and minimizing overhead, leading to the best average turnaround time for a given workload. Finding this optimal quantum is an important tuning aspect for operating systems.
