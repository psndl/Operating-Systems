### 1. OS Definition & Roles

- **Operating System (OS):** A system software that
    
    - Manages hardware resources (CPU, memory, I/O devices)
        
    - Provides an interface (API/commands) for user applications
        
- Acts as a **resource allocator** and **program execution controller**
    

### 2. Major Tasks of an OS

1. **Process Management**
    
    - Creating, scheduling, and terminating processes
        
    - Context switching between processes
        
    - Handling inter-process communication and synchronization
        
2. **Memory Management**
    
    - Allocating/deallocating memory to processes
        
    - Virtual memory abstraction
        
    - Protecting memory access and managing caches
        
3. **File System Management**
    
    - Organizing files/directories
        
    - Handling read/write operations
        
    - Managing access control and persistence on disk
        
4. **Device Management**
    
    - Interfacing with hardware via drivers
        
    - Managing device queues and resource sharing
        
    - Buffering and caching I/O data
        
5. **Security & Protection**
    
    - Enforcing user permissions
        
    - Providing isolation between processes
        
    - Implementing authentication and access controls
        
6. **User Interface**
    
    - CLI (Command-Line Interface) or GUI (Graphical User Interface)
        
    - Shells for user commands, visual environment for apps
        

### 3. System Components

- **Kernel:** Core module directly interacting with hardware
    
- **Shell/User Interface:** User-facing layer that parses commands
    
- **Utilities:** Tools and services to support OS usage and maintenance
    

### 4. Computing Environments

- **Batch Systems:** Jobs queued for sequential processing; minimal interaction
    
- **Time‑Sharing Systems:** Multiple users concurrently with CPU time slicing
    
- **Distributed Systems:** Multiple networked computers collaborating
    
- **Multiprocessor Systems:** Parallel CPUs under one OS for performance
    
- **Real‑Time Systems:** Strict timing constraints (e.g., avionics, medical devices)
    

### 5. OS Types Overview

|Type|Characteristics|Use Cases|
|---|---|---|
|Batch OS|Sequential execution, queuing|Legacy systems|
|Time-Sharing OS|Fast context switching for interactive use|UNIX, Linux desktops|
|Real-Time OS (RTOS)|Mini-latency guarantees|Robotics, embedded systems|
|Distributed OS|Resource sharing over networks|Cloud & cluster computing|
|Multiprocessing OS|Takes advantage of multiple CPUs|Servers, high-performance computing|

## Why These Concepts Matter

- Understanding the OS underpins all computing systems—from desktops to servers.
    
- Knowledge of process and memory management is critical for optimizing performance.
    
- File system and device management are foundational for reliable data storage and hardware interaction.
    
- Familiarity with OS types informs system design decisions in different application contexts.
