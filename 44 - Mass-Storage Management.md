## 1. Overview of Mass-Storage Management

An operating system’s mass-storage management component is responsible for controlling and scheduling access to secondary storage devices, ensuring that data is stored and retrieved efficiently, reliably, and fairly among competing processes. It abstracts the physical characteristics of disks into logical blocks, provides buffering and caching, and implements policies for disk scheduling, allocation, and protection ([csee.umbc.edu](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/~jtang/archives/cs421.f19/lectures/L22MassStorage.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Lecture 22: Mass Storage"), [cs.csustan.edu](https://www.cs.csustan.edu/~john/Classes/CS3750/Notes/Chap11/11_MassStorageStructure.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Chapter Eleven -- Mass-Storage Structure -- Lecture Notes")).

## 2. Physical Structure of Storage Devices

Secondary storage devices (e.g., HDDs, SSDs, tape drives) expose two main abstractions:

- **Physical Geometry (HDDs):** Platters divided into concentric tracks and further into sectors; multiple platters form cylinders; head movement and rotation latency dominate access time ([csee.umbc.edu](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/~jtang/archives/cs421.f19/lectures/L22MassStorage.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Lecture 22: Mass Storage"), [cs.fsu.edu](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~lacher/courses/COP4610/lectures_9e/ch10.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Chapter 10: Mass-Storage Systems")).
    
- **Performance Parameters:**
    
    - _Seek time_ (moving heads between tracks)
        
    - _Rotational latency_ (waiting for sector under head)
        
    - _Transfer rate_ (bytes per second once head is in place) ([csee.umbc.edu](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/~jtang/archives/cs421.f19/lectures/L22MassStorage.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Lecture 22: Mass Storage"), [cs.fsu.edu](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~lacher/courses/COP4610/lectures_9e/ch10.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Chapter 10: Mass-Storage Systems")).

## 3. Logical Structure and Disk Management

- **Logical Blocks:** OS views storage as an array of fixed‐size blocks (e.g., 512 B or 4 KB).
    
- **Partitioning:** Disks are divided into partitions recorded in a partition table (MBR/GPT). Primary, extended, and logical partitions let multiple file systems coexist ([studocu.com](https://www.studocu.com/in/document/anna-university/introduction-to-operating-systems/unit-4-lecture-notes/85345776?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Unit 4 - Lecture notes - Unit-IV STORAGE MANAGEMENT Mass ..."), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Disk partitioning")).
    
- **Formatting:**
    
    - _Low-level (physical)_: Establishes sector and track layout at the device level.
        
    - _High-level (logical)_: Creates file‐system structures (superblock, inodes, directory tables) on top of partitions ([studocu.com](https://www.studocu.com/in/document/anna-university/introduction-to-operating-systems/unit-4-lecture-notes/85345776?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Unit 4 - Lecture notes - Unit-IV STORAGE MANAGEMENT Mass ..."), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Disk partitioning")).

## 4. Disk Scheduling Algorithms

To optimize access times, OSs employ various I/O schedulers (sometimes called disk schedulers):

1. **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served):** Simple but can lead to long seeks.
    
2. **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First):** Picks the request closest to current head position; may starve distant requests.
    
3. **SCAN (“Elevator”):** Head moves back and forth, servicing requests in one direction.
    
4. **C-SCAN:** Similar to SCAN but jumps back to start when it reaches the end, providing more uniform wait times.
    
5. **LOOK/C-LOOK:** Variants that reverse or jump based on the furthest pending request rather than physical end of disk ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I/O_scheduling?utm_source=chatgpt.com "I/O scheduling")).

## 5. RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)

RAID combines multiple disks into a single logical unit to improve performance, reliability, or both. Common levels include:

- **RAID 0 (Striping):** Data split across disks for high throughput; no redundancy.
    
- **RAID 1 (Mirroring):** Full copy on each disk; high reliability, lower capacity.
    
- **RAID 5 (Distributed Parity):** Stripes with single parity block per stripe; tolerates one drive failure.
    
- **RAID 6 (Dual Parity):** Two parity blocks per stripe; tolerates two simultaneous failures.
    
- **RAID 10 (1+0):** Mirror pairs striped together, combining the benefits of RAID 1 and RAID 0 ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Standard RAID levels - Wikipedia")).

## 6. Logical Volume Management (LVM)

LVM adds a virtualization layer over physical disks (or RAID arrays), allowing:

- Dynamic resizing of “logical volumes” without repartitioning.
    
- Snapshotting, thin provisioning, and online migration.
    
- Flexibly combining or splitting volumes across multiple devices ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_volume_management?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Logical volume management")).

## 7. Reliability, Error Handling, and Recovery

- **Bad-block Management:** OS maintains a list of known bad sectors and remaps them to spare areas.
    
- **Error Detection:** Checksums or CRCs detect data corruption on read/write.
    
- **Recovery Mechanisms:** Media scrubbing, parity/regeneration (e.g., in RAID), and journaling file systems minimize data loss ([courses.cs.washington.edu](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse451/13wi/lectures/14%20-%20Raid%20and%20Volumes.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) and OS structure")).

## 8. Boot Process and Disk I/O

- **Boot Block:** First sector (MBR) contains bootloader code and partition table.
    
- **Bootloader Stages:**
    
    1. _Stage 1:_ Loaded by BIOS from MBR; loads Stage 2.
        
    2. _Stage 2:_ Loads OS kernel into memory.
        
- After kernel load, OS initializes I/O subsystem, mounts root file system, and starts services ([csee.umbc.edu](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/~jtang/archives/cs421.f19/lectures/L22MassStorage.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Lecture 22: Mass Storage")).
