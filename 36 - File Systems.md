## üìÅ 1. Role & Goals of File Systems

- Provide persistent storage: files & directories survive across reboots.
    
- Abstract physical storage (disk/tape) with user-friendly structures.
    
- Support diverse file types and sizes; manage space allocation dynamically.
    
- Enforce security via permissions and ownership. ([minnie.tuhs.org](https://minnie.tuhs.org/CompArch/Resources/os-notes.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Advanced Topic in Operating Systems Lecture Notes"), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Inode"))

## 2. File‚ÄêSystem Metadata

- **Inodes (Index Nodes)**: Core metadata containers storing:
    
    - File attributes (owner, permissions, timestamps).
        
    - Disk block pointers to actual data. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Inode"))
        
- **Directory entries** map file/directory names to inode numbers‚Äîcreating a hierarchical tree.
    
- Metadata usually consumes 2‚Äì10% of disk space. ([minnie.tuhs.org](https://minnie.tuhs.org/CompArch/Resources/os-notes.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Advanced Topic in Operating Systems Lecture Notes"))

## 3. Directory Structures

- Implemented as tree hierarchies.
    
- Support files with multiple hard links via shared inode references; not supported for directories on most systems.

## 4. Allocation Strategies

- **Contiguous Allocation**
    
    - Pros: optimal sequential I/O
        
    - Cons: fragmentation, resizing difficulties
        
- **Non-Contiguous Allocation** (blocks, extents)
    
    - Better growth flexibility
        
    - Use of extent mapping (e.g., ext4) reduces fragmentation. ([cis.upenn.edu](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~lee/03cse380/lectures/ln2-process-v4.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] CSE 380 Computer Operating Systems - UPenn CIS"), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Ext4"))

## 5. Journaling & Crash Recovery

- Journaling tracks pending metadata (and optionally data) updates.
    
- On crash, system replays journal to consistency before mounting. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journaling_file_system?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Journaling file system"), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Ext4"))
    
- Prevents inconsistent structures, limits fsck delays.
    

---

## 6. Space Management

- Free space tracked via bitmap or free-list.
    
- Upon create/delete, update allocation structures‚Äîensuring no duplication or leakage. System tools verify consistency. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journaling_file_system?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Journaling file system"), [minnie.tuhs.org](https://minnie.tuhs.org/CompArch/Resources/os-notes.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Advanced Topic in Operating Systems Lecture Notes"))

## 7. Directory & Block Metadata Updates

- Directory and allocation updates often journaled immediately.
    
- File data may be buffered for performance.
    

---

## 8. Bad Blocks & Backups

- Disks contain bad sectors; FS marks and avoids them.
    
- Regular full/incremental backups and journaling help restore after failures.
    

---

## 9. Modern Filesystem Examples

- **ext4** (Linux):
    
    - Supports extents, large files, project quotas, transparent encryption, lazy init, write barriers. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Ext4"))
        
- **JFS** (IBM):
    
    - Built-in journaling, metadata journaling, B+ tree for directories, dynamic inode allocation. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFS_%28file_system%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com "JFS (file system)"))

## 10. FS‚ÄëLevel Concepts & Tradeoffs

- **Performance vs Integrity**: journaling boosts reliability at some performance cost.
    
- **Block size choice**: affects fragmentation and I/O efficiency.
    
- **Structure design**: uses extents, inodes, and trees for fast lookup and scalability.

- **Caching & Buffering**: Improving performance in memory before disk writes.
    
- **Snapshot & Copy-on-Write systems** (e.g., ZFS, Btrfs): advanced recovery and versioning methods.
