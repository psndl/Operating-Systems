## üìò Lecture Overview: Virtual Memory

### 1. **Purpose of Virtual Memory**

- **Resource abstraction & isolation**
    
    - Creates the illusion that each process has its own contiguous, exclusive memory space.
        
- **Efficient memory use**
    
    - Enables multi-processing by allowing inactive memory to reside on disk until needed.
        
- **Safety & protection**
    
    - Prevents processes from accessing others' memory inadvertently.
        

### 2. **Key Concepts**

- **Logical (virtual) address vs. Physical address**
    
    - A process uses virtual addresses; the MMU (Memory Management Unit) translates them to real RAM locations.
        
- **Pages & Frames**
    
    - Memory divided into fixed-size chunks called _pages_ (virtual) and _frames_ (physical).
        
- **Page table**
    
    - A per-process table mapping virtual pages to physical frames (and disk swap location if paged out).
        
- **Page fault**
    
    - Triggered when accessing a non-resident page; system pauses execution to load the page into RAM.
        

### 3. **Address Translation**

- **MMU & Page Table Walk**
    
    - MMU checks the page table to map virtual addresses to physical memory.
        
- **TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)**
    
    - Cache for recent translations to cut down translation time.
        
- **Multi-level page tables**
    
    - Use hierarchical mappings (e.g., two-level, inverted) to efficiently represent sparse address spaces.
        

### 4. **Swapping and Demand Paging**

- **Demand paging**
    
    - Loads pages into RAM only upon first access to optimize memory usage.
        
- **Swap space (disk)**
    
    - A designated area for temporarily holding evicted pages.
        
- **Page replacement policies**
    
    - Strategies include FIFO, LRU, Clock (approximate LRU), and Optimal (reference-based ideal).
        
- **Thrashing**
    
    - Occurs when excessive page faults severely degrade performance‚Äîindicative of over-commitment.
        

### 5. **Working Set & Memory Allocation**

- **Working set**
    
    - The subset of pages a process needs to access in a given period; ensures active pages stay in RAM.
        
- **Page proximity & locality**
    
    - Temporal (recent access) and spatial (nearby memory addresses) locality guide caching effectiveness.
        

### 6. **Shared Memory & Copy-on-Write (COW)**

- **Shared code/data segments**
    
    - Multiple processes can use the same pages in read-only mode to conserve memory.
        
- **COW**
    
    - Defers allocating separate copy until a process attempts to write, reducing unnecessary duplication.
        

### 7. **Virtual Memory in Modern OS**

- **Memory-mapped files**
    
    - Map disk file contents directly into a process‚Äôs address space.
        
- **Protection modes**
    
    - Page table entries include bits for Read/Write/Execute permissions, enabling security enforcement.
        
- **Hardware support**
    
    - CPU features like NX bits prevent execution of data pages; segmentation may still be used in combination.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Extended Insights (Beyond Lecture)

- **Multi-level vs. Inverted tables**
    
    - _Multi-level_ maps large sparse spaces efficiently.
        
    - _Inverted_ tables index by physical frame, saving memory but requiring hashing and scan overhead.
        
- **Approximate LRU (Clock Algorithm)**
    
    - Uses a circular list and second-chance bits for efficient eviction decisions within limited resources.
        
- **Copy-on-Write usage scenarios**
    
    - Common in process forks: parent and child share pages until one writes, minimizing duplication.
        
- **Security enforcement**
    
    - OS checks permissions on each translation; hardware faults on violations.
        
    - NX bit blocks execution in marked non-executable pages, protecting against buffer-overflow exploits.
        
- **Virtual memory beyond OS**
    
    - Used in GPUs and language runtimes for efficient sandboxing and memory sharing.
