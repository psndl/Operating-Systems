## 1. What is a Deadlock?

A **deadlock** happens when two or more processes are stuck waiting for resources held by each other, so none can proceed. It’s like four people trying to pass one another in a narrow hallway—they each block the next.

### The Four Necessary Conditions

All must hold simultaneously:

1. **Mutual Exclusion** – Resources can’t be shared (e.g., printers).
    
2. **Hold and Wait** – Processes hold some resources while waiting for others.
    
3. **No Preemption** – Resources can’t be forcibly taken away.
    
4. **Circular Wait** – A closed chain of processes, each waiting for a resource held by the next.

## 2. Deadlock Handling Approaches

### 2.A. Detection & Recovery

- **Detection algorithms** identify deadlocks.
    
- Systems may **abort** or **preempt** processes to reclaim resources.
    

### 2.B. Prevention

Break one of the four conditions:

- **Mutual Exclusion** – Make resources shareable if possible.
    
- **Hold and Wait** – Force processes to request all resources at once.
    
- **No Preemption** – If waiting can’t be satisfied, roll back and release.
    
- **Circular Wait** – Impose a strict resource ordering; processes must request in order.
    

### 2.C. Avoidance

- Track resource allocation and grant only “safe” requests to avoid deadlock.
    
- **Banker’s Algorithm**:
    
    - Processes declare **maximum resource claims** in advance.
        
    - System simulates allocations: only if the state is safe (all processes can eventually complete) is the request granted.
        
    - Ensures no circular wait can arise.

## 3. Banker's Algorithm in Detail

- **Data structures**: `Available`, `Max`, `Allocation`, `Need = Max - Allocation`.
    
- **Safety check**:
    
    - Work ← Available, Finish[i] ← false for all processes.
        
    - If a process's `Need ≤ Work`, simulate execution: `Work += Allocation`, mark it Finish=true. Repeat.
        
    - If all processes finish, the state is “safe.”
        
- **On resource request**:
    
    - Temporarily allocate and then run the safety check.
        
    - If safe → commit; if not → force wait.
        

Banker’s provides strong guarantees without requiring full prevention but requires advance claims and bookkeeping.

## 4. Practical Comparison

- **Prevention** is simple but can waste resources and reduce concurrency (e.g., grabbing everything upfront).
    
- **Detection & recovery** is reactive but manageable in low-stakes systems.
    
- **Avoidance (e.g. Banker’s)** is optimal but complex and mostly theoretical — difficult in dynamic or large systems.
    

Real OSes often combine these: allow limited preemption, minimize hold‑and‑wait, and use timeouts or watchdogs to recover from rare deadlocks.

## 5. Broader Context & Greener Insights

- Deadlocks are a problem in most resource-sharing systems—file locks, DB locks, printers.
    
- In distributed systems, extra issues arise: faulty detection, network latency.
    
- Many modern applications use **timeouts**, **retry logic**, or **idempotency** rather than complex prevention.
