## ðŸ§  Lecture 41: Memory Management

### 1. Objectives

- Understand goals and methods for managing process memory.
    
- Explore memory allocation strategies.
    
- Examine paging, segmentation, and virtual memory systems.
    

---

### 2. Motivation & Basic Concepts

- **Primary memory** (RAM) is limited, expensive, but fast.
    
- **Multiprogramming** allows multiple processes to reside concurrently in memory.
    
- Memory management helps:
    
    - Load multiple processes.
        
    - Maximize CPU utilization and throughput.
        
    - Provide isolation and protection for processes.

### 3. Memory Allocation Techniques

#### a. Contiguous Allocation

- Each process is assigned a single, contiguous memory block.
    
- **Challenges**:
    
    - _Internal fragmentation_: wasted space inside fixed-size blocks.
        
    - _External fragmentation_: scattered small free blocks.
        
- **Solutions**:
    
    - **First-fit, Best-fit, Worst-fit**: different strategies to pick free holes.
        
    - **Compaction**: shifting processes to combine free memory segments.
        

#### b. Nonâ€‘contiguous Allocation

- Processes can occupy multiple memory blocks.
    
- Eliminates external fragmentation.
    
- Requires more complex address translation.

### 4. Paging

- Physical memory and logical (virtual) memory are split into fixed-size blocks: **frames** and **pages**.
    
- The **page table** maps process pages to physical frames.
    
- Reduces fragmentation and simplifies allocation.
    

**Key Points**:

- A virtual address is split into a **page number** (index into page table) and **offset** within page.
    
- **Page tables** can be large; multi-level paging (hierarchical) saves space by only creating needed tables.
    

---

### 5. Segmentation

- Memory divided into segments of varying length, representing logical divisions (code, data, stack).
    
- Each segment has **(base, limit)** for bounds checking.
    
- Enables logical structuring but still suffers fragmentation.
    

---

### 6. Virtual Memory & Demand Paging

- **Virtual memory** lets processes use more memory than physically available by storing inactive pages on disk (swap).
    
- **Demand Paging**: pages are loaded only when accessed.
    

**Page Replacement Algorithms**:

- **FIFO** (First In, First Out)
    
- **FIFO Clock** (Second-chance)
    
- **LRU** (Least Recently Used)
    
- **Optimal** (theoretical reference)
    

**Page Faults**:

- Occur when accessing a non-resident page.
    
- Requires loading from disk, which can slow down the system.
    
- **Thrashing** happens when excessive page swapping dominates CPU time.
    

---

### 7. Performance Optimization

- Use of **TLBs** (Translation Lookaside Buffers) to cache recent address translations.
    
- **Working set model**: maintain in-memory the set of pages used recently by a process.
    
- **Load control**: limit number of processes in memory to avoid thrashing.

### 8. NPTEL Context (Memory Management â€“ LectureÂ 41)

In NPTELâ€™s Operating Systems lecture #41, memory management is introduced as part of week 9. Topics covered include segmentation, paging, and virtual memoryâ€”perfectly aligning with the video content and filling in theoretical details ([archive.nptel.ac.in](https://archive.nptel.ac.in/courses/106/105/106105214/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Computer Science and Engineering - NOC:Operating System ... - Nptel"), [scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/174382467/HPC-Lecture11?utm_source=chatgpt.com "HPC Lecture11 | PDF | Operating System | Process (Computing)"), [lee.edu](https://lee.edu/catalog/files/huntsville/lchc-2015-16.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Huntsville Catalog, 2015-2016 - Lee College")).

### 9. Worked Examples

**Example: Virtual Address Translation**

- Virtual address `V = 0x3A7F`
    
    - Page size = 4â€¯KB â†’ offset = lower 12 bits, page number = upper bits.
        
    - Retrieve frame number from page table and compute physical address = frame Ã— 4â€¯KB + offset.
        

**Page Replacement Scenario**

- Frames: 3, reference string: 7,0,1,2,0,3,0,4
    
    - FIFO result: 7 page faults
        
    - LRU result: fewer faults due to keeping frequently used pages.

### 10. Summary Comparison Table

|Concept|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|---|
|Contiguous Allocation|Simple, fast|Fragmentation issues|
|Paging|No external fragmentation, easy swapping|Page table overhead|
|Segmentation|Logical structure|External fragmentation|
|Virtual Memory|Support large processes, isolation|Disk I/O overhead, complexity, thrashing risk|

### 11. Final Notes

- Memory management determines system efficiency, stability, and multitasking ability.
    
- Modern OS often uses **combined paging + segmentation** (e.g., x86 systems).
    
- Evaluating algorithms involves measuring throughput, response time, and resource utilization.
